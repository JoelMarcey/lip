Note to readers: On December 1, 2020, the Libra Association was renamed to Diem Association. The project repos are in the process of being migrated. All projects will remain available for use here until the migration to a new GitHub Organization is complete.

Libra Improvement Proposals (LIP) describe standards for the Libra Payment Network (LPN) including the core blockchain protocol and the development platform (Move), smart contracts and systems for smart contract verification, standards for the deployment and operation of the LPN, APIs for accessing the LPN and processing information from the LPN, and off-chain mechanisms.

To submit or modify a LIP please refer to the instructions outlined on [lip.libra.org](https://lip.libra.org).
