# Summary
---
The Off-Chain Protocol allows two services to define payments off-chain and privately exchange information required for compliance purposes before settling a Libra payment on-chain. Note that this API is being published by the Libra Association on an “as is” basis.  Publication of this API by the Libra Association does not mean that the Association is taking any position on whether the API addresses issues of compliance, privacy and scalability.  Users of this API must make such determinations on their own.

---
# Abstract / Motivation
---

The Off-Chain Protocol is an API and payload specification to support compliance, privacy and scalability on blockchains. It is executed between a pair of entities and allows them to privately exchange payment information before they settle it on a Blockchain.  The entities can be inclusive of designated dealers (DDs) and _Virtual Asset Service Providers_ (VASPs), such as wallets or exchanges.

The Off-Chain Protocol relates to _supporting compliance_, and in particular supporting the implementation of the _Travel Rule_ requirements that VASPs may be required to follow. Those requirements generally specify that when money transfers above a certain amount are executed by VASPs, some information about the sender and recipient of funds must become available to both VASPs. The Off-Chain Protocols allows VASPs to exchange this information privately.

The Off-Chain Protocol provides higher levels of privacy than those that can be achieved directly on a Blockchain. The exact details of the customer accounts involved in a payment, as well as personal information that may need to be exchanged to support compliance, remain off-chain. The information is exchanged within a secure, authenticated and encrypted, Channel and would only be made available to the parties that strictly require them.

## Overview

Two VASPs participate in the off-chain protocol. They communicate through HTTP request and responses protected with TLS, and exchange messages that are signed to ensure authenticity and integrity. A VASP can define a `PaymentCommand` that creates or updates a single `PaymentObject`. Each `PaymentCommand` is sent to the other VASP in a `CommandRequestObject` and responded to by a `CommandResponseObject`. A success status in the response signals that the command was a success and the payment is updated by both VASPs (a command failure indicates the command is invalid, and a protocol failure indicates the command should be resubmitted at a later time).

A VASP initially creates a `PaymentObject`, and then VASPs take turns updating it, through successful `PaymentCommands`, until it is  ready to be settled or aborted. In a typical protocol flow the VASP representing the sender would define the `PaymentObject` and include the senders KYC information. The receiver VASP would check this information and either request more (see `soft-match` flows), abort or signal that it is ready to settle the payment, by updating sending the receiver's KYC information. The sender's VASP would check the receiver's KYC, and request more, abort or settle the payment on-chain.

The remaining of this document details the specifications for Commands, Objects and the typical and exceptional flows to define Payments and their Commands.

---
# Specification
---

# Terminology
**Object**: Equivalent to a record in a database.  A PaymentObject is an example of an Object representing a payment.

**Command**: An instruction sent over a Channel to mutate/create one or more Objects.  In the case of a mutation, this Command will depend upon the current value of one of more existing Shared Objects.

**Channel**: The communication path between a pair of entities who execute Commands and track the evolution of a set of Shared Objects.

**Shared Object**: All Objects contained within a Command - for example `PaymentObject`s, are considered as "Shared Objects" - meaning that either VASP may create a new Command to modify the Object, and will do so during the typical life-cycle of an Object - an example being the addition of required data within the `KycDataObject` from both VASPs to a payment Object. Only one VASPs in a Channel can may at any time attempt to initiate and execute a Commands on Shared Objects, defined by the state of the Object.

**Version**: The state of an Object at a specific point in time.  Every creation or mutation creates a new Version of the Object which was created/mutated.  VASPs operate upon the latest Version of Shared Objects.  Once a Version is mutated, it is no longer a valid Version upon which a new Command may depend - the newly updated value of the Version is the latest Version for that Object and must be acted upon.

**reference_id**: Every Object type contains a `reference_id` field which is a unique reference ID for the Object.  The reference ID is used as a unique identifier of the Object. The reference ID is always specified by the payment initiator VASP (the VASP which originally created the Object). This value should be unique, and formatted as `<creator_vasp_onchain_address_bech32>_<unique_id>`. For example, `lbr1x23456abcd_seqABCD`. As an example, see the `reference_id` field on the [PaymentObject](#paymentobject). Unicode utf-8 encoded.

### On-Chain Account Setup
A VASP's on-chain account must be created and set up in accordance with the standard VASP account creation process.

Of particular note for off-chain APIs is the compliance key value.  This is the Ed25519 key with which a VASP signs travel rule statements on-chain and all off-chain requests and responses. During account creation, a VASP will set their compliance key which will be stored under the primary VASP account.

### HTTP end-point

Each VASP exposes an HTTPS POST end point at `https://<hostname>:<port>/<protocol_version>/<LocalVASPAddress>/<RemoteVASPAddress>/command`.

* `protocol_version` is initially `v1` for this iteration of the off-chain APIs.
* `LocalVASPAddress` and `RemoteVASPAddress` are the bech32 VASP addresses of the respective VASPs - with the subaddress set to 0's as per [LIP 5](https://lip.libra.org/lip-5/).
    * An example URL: http://127.0.0.1:7091/v1/lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m/lbr1pgfpyysjzgfpyysjzgfpyysjzggqqqqqqqqqqqqqxjt54z/command


### HTTP Headers
All HTTP requests and responses must contain a header `X-Request-ID` with a unique ID for the request, used for tracking requests and debugging. Responses must have the same string in the `X-Request-ID` header value as the requests they correspond to.

### Payloads
The exposed endpoint receives JWS signed `CommandRequestObject`s in the POST body, and responds with a JWS signed `CommandResponseObject`s in the HTTP response (See [Request/Response Payload](#requestresponse-payload) for more details. Single Command requests-responses are supported (HTTP1.0) but also pipelined request-responses are supported (HTTP1.1). The content type of the HTTP request/response is ignored. The version for the Off-Chain Protocol is the string `0`.  All structures transmitted, nested within `CommandRequestObject` and `CommandResponseObject` are valid JSON serialized Objects and can be parsed and serialized using standard JSON libraries.

All transmitted requests/responses are signed by the sending party using the JWS Signature standard (with the Ed25519 / EdDSA cipher suite, and `compact` encoding).  The party's on-chain compliance key shall be used to sign these messages. This ensures all information and meta-data about payments is authenticated and cannot be repudiated.


## Basic Protocol CommandRequest / CommandResponse Interaction
Assume two VASPs A and B.  The basic protocol interaction consists of:

* An initiating VASP A creates a `CommandRequestObject` containing a Command of the desired type.  Commands inform the other VASP what to create or mutate.  Every Command includes one or more Objects to create or update.  For each of those Objects, the Version of that Object is updated by the Command and the old Version becomes obsolete once the Command is applied successfully.
* VASP A packages the Command via JWS using EdDSA and compact encoding.
* VASP A establishes a connection to VASP B and sends the packaged Command to VASP B in the body of an HTTP POST.
* VASP B listens for requests, and when received, verifies VASP A's signature and then processes the request to generate and send `CommandResponseObject` responses, with a success or failure status, through the HTTP response body. In case of an error that prevents VASP B from parsing an incoming `CommandRequestObject` an HTTP error code is returned.
* The initiating VASP A receives the response, verifies its signature, and processes it to assess whether it was successful or not.

If VASP A fails to receive a response from VASP B, or in the case of specific protocol failure codes, it must re-send the request at some cadence until a response is received to ensure eventual consistency.

# Command Sequencing: Object Versioning and Next Writer

As mentioned in [Terminology](#terminology), every Object type contains a `reference_id` field which is a unique reference ID for the Object.

Each VASP also associates with an object its **latest version**, as the last command ID (`cid`) that created or updated it. Commands specify the list of objects and versions they expect to operate on (the `_reads` field), and the list of objects and versions they create if the command is a success (the `_writes` field). Sample generation of the `cid` can be done with something similar to (in `python3` syntax):
```
urandom(16).hex()
```

Given the state of an object there is an unambigious way to define who the **next writer** to the object should be (unless the object is in a terminal state and no more commands should be issued on it). Only this VASP is allowed to issue a command to update this Object, and a command from the other VASP will be rejected as a command failure. This prevents concurrent attempts to update Objects that could lead to inconsistencies.

<img alt="Object Versioning" src={useBaseUrl('img/object_versioning.png')} />

# Network Error Handling

In the case of network failure, the sending party for this Command is required to re-send the Command until it gets a response from the counterparty VASP.  An exponential backoff is suggested for Command re-sends.  This retransmission strategy allows the Off-Chain Protocol to achieve [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) of the Shared Objects.

Upon receipt of a Command that has already been processed (resulting in a success response or a Command error), the receiving side must reply with the same response as was previously issued (successful commands, or commands that fail with a command error, are _idempotent_). Requests that resulted in protocol errors (such as `wait`) may result in different responses. For example if VASP A sends a Requests to VASP B, and VASP B responds with a `wait` protocol error, later VASP A may re-send the same request, and VASP B may respond with a `success` or a different error.

# Request/Response Payload
All requests between VASPs are structured as [`CommandRequestObject`s](#commandrequestobject) and all responses are structured as [`CommandResponseObject`s](#commandresponseobject).  The resulting request takes a form of the following (prior to JWS signing):

```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandRequestObject",
    "command_type": "PaymentCommand", // Command type
    "command": CommandObject(), // Object of type as specified by command_type
    "cid": "12ce83f66d180d6e08b6c00fdbbf085a",

}
```

A response would look like the following:
```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
    "status": "success",
    "cid": "12ce83f66d180d6e08b6c00fdbbf085a"
}
```


### CommandRequestObject
All requests between VASPs are structured as `CommandRequestObject`s.

| Field 	   | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	   |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| _ObjectType  | str    | Y | Fixed value: `CommandRequestObject`|
| command_type | str    | Y | A string representing the type of Command contained in the request. |
| command      | Command object | Y | The Command to sequence. |
| cid | str    | Y     | A unique identifier for the Command. |


```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandRequestObject",
    "command_type": CommandType,
    "command": CommandObject(),
    "cid": str,
}
```

### CommandResponseObject
All responses to a CommandRequestObject are in the form of a CommandResponseObject

| Field 	     | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	     |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| _ObjectType    | str      | Y             | The fixed string `CommandResponseObject`. |
| status         | str      | Y             | Either `success` or `failure`. |
| error          | List of [OffChainErrorObject](#offchainerrorobject) | N | Details on errors when status == "failure" |
| cid            | str      | N | The Command identifier to which this is a response. |


```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
    "error": [OffChainErrorObject()],
    "status": "failure"
    "cid": str,
}
```

When the `CommandResponseObject` status field is `failure`, the `error` field is included in the response to indicate the nature of the failure. The `error` field (type `OffChainError`) is a list of OffChainError objects. In case of failure to recover the request (such as a parsing failure or a signature failure) `cid` may be omitted.

### OffChainErrorObject
Represents an error that occurred in response to a Command.

| Field 	     | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	     |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| type    | str (enum)     | Y             | Either "command_error" or "protocol_error"|
| field            | str       | N             | The field on which this error occurred|
| code    | str (enum) | Y    | The error code of the corresponding error |
| message         | str      | N             | Additional details about this error |

```
{
    "type": "command_error",
    "field": "0.sender.kyc_data.surname",
    "code": "missing_data",
    "message": "",
}
```
'command_error' occurs in response to a Command failing to be applied - for example, invalid `_reads` values, or high level validation errors.  `protocol_error` occurs in response to a failure related to the lower-level protocol.  Note: Additional information detailing all errors will be added.


# Travel Rule Data Exchange

In the initial version of the off-chain APIs, the usage is intended as a means of transferring travel-rule information between VASPs.  The following will detail the request and response payloads utilized for this purpose.

## Request/Response Payload
All requests between VASPs are structured as [`CommandRequestObject`s](basic_building_blocks.md#commandrequestobject) and all responses are structured as [`CommandResponseObject`s](basic_building_blocks.md#commandresponseobject).  For a travel-rule data exchange, the resulting request takes a form of the following:

```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandRequestObject",
    "command_type": "PaymentCommand",
    "cid": "88b282d6181129f682be0421d0ee9887",
    "command": {
	    "_ObjectType": "PaymentCommand",
        "_reads": {
            "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_5b8403c986f53fe072301fe950d030cb": "fd52e9c2a7ccc96be564d67199774fbc"
        },
        "_writes": {
            "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_5b8403c986f53fe072301fe950d030cb": "88b282d6181129f682be0421d0ee9887"
        },
	    "payment": {
		    "sender": {
			    "address": "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9skzctpv9skzcg9kmwta",
			    "kyc_data": {
				    "payload_type": "KYC_DATA"
				    "payload_version": 1,
				    "type": "individual",
				    "given_name": "ben",
				    "surname": "maurer",
				    "address": {
					"city": "Sunnyvale",
					"country": "US",
					"line1": "1234 Maple Street",
					"line2": "Apartment 123",
					"postal_code": "12345",
					"state": "California",
				    },
				    "dob": "1920-03-20",
				    "place_of_birth": {
					"city": "Sunnyvale",
					"country": "US",
					"postal_code": "12345",
					"state": "California",
				    }
				},
			    	"status": {
			    		"status": "ready_for_settlement",
			    	}
			},
		    "receiver": {
			    "address": "lbr1pgfpyysjzgfpyysjzgfpyysjzgf3xycnzvf3xycsm957ne",
			},
		    "reference_id": "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_5b8403c986f53fe072301fe950d030cb",
		    "action": {
			    "amount": 100,
			    "currency": "USD",
			    "action": "charge",
			    "timestamp": 72322,
			},
		    "description": "A free form or structured description of the payment.",
		},
	},
}
```

A response would look like the following:
```
{
    "_ObjectType": "CommandResponseObject",
    "status": "success",
}
```

### CommandRequestObject
For a travel rule data exchange, the [command_type](basic_building_blocks.md#commandrequestobject) field is set to "PaymentCommand".  The Command Object is a [`PaymentCommand` Object](#paymentcommand-object).

### PaymentCommand Object
| Field 	    | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	    |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| _ObjectType   | str  | Y             | The fixed string `PaymentCommand` |
| payment| [`PaymentObject`](#paymentobject) | Y | contains a `PaymentObject` that either creates a new payment or updates an existing payment. Note that strict validity check apply when updating payments, that are listed in the section below describing these Objects. An invalid update or initial payment Object results in a Command error
| _reads | JSON Object map |  Y | Must be an Object containing mappings of `reference_id` to latest Version as represented by the `cid` of the latest Command which successfully mutated the Object referenced by the `reference_id`. The value in this field must match a `cid` previously specified by a Command by the `_writes` parameter on a prior Command for this payment Object.  For a payment Command, only zero or one `_reads` values should be specified since payments are only dependent upon at most prior Version of an Object. A list with any other number of items results in a Command error.  If the list is empty this payment Command defines a new payment. If the list contains one item, then this Command updates the shared `PaymentObject`. |
| _writes | JSON object map | Y | For a payment Command, the `_writes` field may only be a single key-value pair since a payment Command only operates upon one Object.  This field maps the `reference_id` of the Object being written to its new Version. |

```
{
    "_ObjectType": "PaymentCommand",
    "_reads": {
            "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_d4115900aad65d8141236b464f1315f5": "35713c723c4d2516c515aa34b3ba9232"
        },
    "_writes": {
            "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_d4115900aad65d8141236b464f1315f5": "12ce83f66d180d6e08b6c00fdbbf085a"
    },
    "payment": {
        PaymentObject(),
    }
}
```

### PaymentObject

The structure in this Object can be a full payment or just the fields of an existing payment Object that need to be changed. Some fields are immutable after they are defined once (see below). Others can by updated multiple times. Updating immutable fields with a different value results in a Command error, but it is acceptable to re-send the same value.

| Field 	    | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	    |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| sender/receiver | [`PaymentActorObject`](#paymentactorobject) | Required for payment creation | Information about the sender/receiver in this payment |
| reference_id | str | Y | Unique reference ID of this payment on the payment initiator VASP (the VASP which originally created this payment Object). This value should be unique, and formatted as “<creator_vasp_onchain_address_bech32>_<unique_id>”.  For example, ”lbr1x23456abcd_seqABCD“. This field is mandatory on payment creation and immutable after that. |
| original_payment_reference_id | str | N | Used for updates to a payment after it has been committed on chain. For example, used for refunds. The reference ID of the original payment will be placed into this field. This value is optional on payment creation and invalid on updates. |
| recipient_signature | str | N | Signature of the recipient of this transaction. The is signed with the compliance key of the recipient VASP and is used for on-chain attestation from the recipient party.  This may be omitted on blockchains which do not require on-chain attestation. Generated via [Recipient Signature](#recipient-signature) |
| action | [`PaymentActionObject`](#paymentactionobject) | Y | Number of cryptocurrency + currency type (LBR, etc.)<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> + type of action to take. This field is mandatory and immutable |
| description | str | N | Description of the payment. To be displayed to the user. Unicode utf-8 encoded max length of 255 characters. This field is optional but can only be written once.

```
{
    "sender": payment_actor_object(),
    "receiver": payment_actor_object(),
    "reference_id": "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_d4115900aad65d8141236b464f1315f5",
    "original_payment_reference_id": "lbr1pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pg9q5zs2pgyqqqqqqqqqqqqqqspa3m_5b8403c986f53fe072301fe950d030cb",
    "recipient_signature": "...",
    "action": payment_action_object(),
    "description": "A free form or structured description of the payment.",
}
```

### PaymentActorObject

A `PaymentActorObject` represents a participant in a payment - either sender or receiver. It also includes the status of the actor, indicates missing information or willingness to settle or abort the payment, and the Know-Your-Customer information of the customer involved in the payment.

| Field 	    | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	    |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| address | str | Y | Address of the sender/receiver account. Addresses may be single use or valid for a limited time, and therefore VASPs should not rely on them remaining stable across time or different VASP addresses. The addresses are encoded using bech32. The bech32 address encodes both the address of the VASP as well as the specific user's subaddress. They should be no longer than 80 characters. Mandatory and immutable. For Libra addresses, refer to "account identifier" section in LIP-5 for format. |
| kyc_data | [KycDataObject](#kycdataobject) | N | The KYC data for this account. This field is optional but immutable once it is set. |
| status | [StatusObject](#statusobject) | Y | Status of the payment from the perspective of this actor. This field can only be set by the respective sender/receiver VASP and represents the status on the sender/receiver VASP side. This field is mandatory by this respective actor (either sender or receiver side) and mutable. |
| metadata | list of str | Y | Can be specified by the respective VASP to hold metadata that the sender/receiver VASP wishes to associate with this payment. This is a mandatory field but can be set to an empty list (i.e. `[]`). New string-typed entries can be appended at the end of the list, but not deleted.
| metadata | list of str | Y | Can be specified by the respective VASP to hold metadata that the sender/receiver VASP wishes to associate with this payment. This is a mandatory field but can be set to an empty list (i.e. `[]`). New string-typed entries can be appended at the end of the list, but not deleted.

```
{
    "address": "lbr1pgfpyysjzgfpyysjzgfpyysjzgf3xycnzvf3xycsm957ne",
    "kyc_data": kyc_data_object(),
    "status": status_object(),
    "metadata": [],
}
```

### KYCDataObject
A `KYCDataObject` represents the required information for a single subaddress.  Proof of non-repudiation is provided by the signatures included in the JWS payloads.  The only mandatory fields are `payload_type`, `payload_version` and `type`. All other fields are optional from the point of view of the protocol -- however they may need to be included for another VASP to be ready to settle the payment.

| Field 	    | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	    |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| payload_type | str | Y | Used to help determine what type of data this will deserialize into.  Always set to KYC_DATA. |
| payload_version | str | Y | Version identifier to allow modifications to KYC data Object without needing to bump version of entire API set.  Set to 1 |
| type | str | Y | Required field, must be either “individual” or “entity” |
| given_name | str | N | Legal given name of the user for which this KYC data Object applies. |
| surname | str | N | Legal surname of the user for which this KYC data Object applies. |
| address | [AddressObject](#addressobject) | N | Physical address data for this account |
| dob | str | N | Date of birth for the holder of this account.  Specified as an ISO 8601 calendar date format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 |
| place_of_birth | [AddressObject](#addressobject) | N | Place of birth for this user.  line1 and line2 fields should not be populated for this usage of the address Object |
| national_id | [NationalIdObject](#nationalidobject) | N | National ID information for the holder of this account |
| legal_entity_name | str | N | Name of the legal entity.  Used when subaddress represents a legal entity rather than an individual. KYCDataObject should only include one of legal_entity_name OR given_name/surname |
| additional_kyc_data | str | N | Freeform KYC data.  If a soft-match occurs, this field should be used to specify additional KYC data which can be used to clear the soft-match.  It is suggested that this data be JSON, XML, or another human-readable form.

```
{
    "id_value": "123-45-6789",
    "country": "US",
    "type": "SSN",
}
```


### PaymentActionObject

| Field 	    | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	    |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| amount | uint | Y | Amount of the transfer.  Base units are the same as for on-chain transactions for this currency.  For example, if LibraUSD is represented on-chain where “1” equals 1e-6 dollars, then “1” equals the same amount here.  For any currency, the on-chain mapping must be used for amounts. |
| currency | enum | Y | One of the supported on-chain currency types - ex. LBR, etc. <a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> |
| action | enum | Y | Populated in the request.  This value indicates the requested action to perform, and the only valid value is `charge`. |
| timestamp | uint | Y | Unix timestamp indicating the time that the payment Command was created.

```
{
    "amount": 100,
    "currency": "USD",
    "action": "charge",
    "timestamp": 72322,
}
```

### StatusObject

| Field 	    | Type 	| Required? 	| Description 	|
|-------	    |------	|-----------	|-------------	|
| status | str enum | Y | Status of the payment from the perspective of this actor. This field can only be set by the respective sender/receiver VASP and represents the status on the sender/receiver VASP side. This field is mandatory by this respective actor (either sender or receiver side) and mutable. Valid values are specified in [ StatusEnum ](#statusenum)  |
| abort_code    | str (enum) | N    | In the case of an `abort` status, this field may be used to describe the reason for the abort. Represents the error code of the corresponding error |
| abort_message         | str      | N             | Additional details about this error.  To be used only when `code` is populated |

```
{
    "status": "needs_kyc_data",
}
```

### StatusEnum
Valid values are:
* `none` - No status is yet set from this actor.
* `needs_kyc_data` - KYC data about the subaddresses is required by this actor.
* `needs_recipient_signature` - Can only be associated with the sender actor.  Means that the sender still requires that the recipient VASP provide the signature so that the transaction can be put on-chain.
* `ready_for_settlement` - Transaction is ready for settlement according to this actor (i.e. the required signatures/KYC data have been provided)
* `abort` - Indicates the actor wishes to abort this payment, instead of settling it.
* `soft_match` - Actor's KYC data resulted in a soft-match. The VASP associated with this actor will need to determine what next steps are required, and if it decides to send additional KYC information to clear the soft-match does so via the KYCObject field of additional_kyc_data. If not sent within SLA window, this transaction will be aborted.


# PaymentObject Protocol Command Sequence

**PaymentObject State.** The state of a `PaymentObject` is used to determine which VASP is expected to issue a command next, and what information is expected to be included in the command to progress the payment. The state is determined by the tuple of the status of the Sender and Receiver Actors and two flags `Sx` and `Rx`. The exact fields in the payment object for Sender and Receiver actor status are `sender.status.status` and `receiver.status.status`. The flag `Sx` and `Rx` are set when the Sender or the Receiver has included `additional_kyc_data` in the actor field (`Sender.kyc_data.additional_kyc_data` and `Receiver.kyc_data.additional_kyc_data` respectively).

The states (Sender Status, Receiver Status, Sx Flag, Rx Flag) are:

Basic KYC exchange flow

* SINIT: (`need_kyc_data`, `none`, `*`, `*`)
* RSEND: (`need_kyc_data`, `ready_for_settlement`, `*`, `*`)
* RABORT: (`need_kyc_data`, `abort`)
* SABORT: (`abort`, `ready_for_settlement`, `*`, `*`)
* READY: (`ready_for_settlement`, `ready_for_settlement`, `*`, `*`)

Soft-match disambiguation states:

* RSOFT (`need_kyc`, `soft_match`, `_`, `_`)
* SSOFTSEND (`need_kyc`, `soft_match`, `Sx`, `_`)
* SSOFT (`soft_match`, `ready_for_settlement`, `*`, `_`)
* RSOFTSEND (`soft_match`, `ready_for_settlement`, `*`, `Rx`)

A star (`*`) denotes _any_ value, while an underscore (`_`) for a flag denotes _not set_.

**Final States and next Writer.** The sender and receiver of the payment take turns issuing `PaymentCommand` Objects, until the object they create or mutate is in one of the final states, namely SABORT, RABORT or READY. The VASP that is the sender of the Payment always creates the Payment Object, and then the receiver and sender take turns to issue commands updating it.

**Protocol Flow Illustration & VASP logic**. The state machine of the protocol is illustrated in the figure below. (TODO: Add figure) An implicit abort state for the sender is available (SABORT) when the sender is expected to provide a command; similarly an implicit receiver abort state (RABORT) can be reached when the receiver is expected to provide a command. The full state transition diagram, including abort states, is available in the appendix. In the diagram below the Sender or Receiver labels on state transition arcs indicate the originator of the command that triggers the transition. Some abort codes may allow a new payment to follow from an aborted payment.

## Steps of the protocol: The KYC Exchange Flow

The basic KYC exchange flow starts with the Sender including KYC information and requesting KYC information by the receiver. In the straight-forward case the Receiver is satisfied with this information and responds with a command providing the receiver KYC information, and recipient signature. The Sender can then finalize the payment and also settle it on-chain (status sequence SINIT -> RSEND -> READY). At each step Sender or Receiver may also abort the payment.

### Start -> SINIT
The Sender issues `PaymentCommand` to create initial payment.

The sender creates a payment object, that they believe requires KYC information exchange. The payment command includes a full payment object including all mandatory fields and the following optional fields populated as:

* `Sender.Status.Status` = `need_kyc_data`.
* `Sender.kyc_data` = The `KycDataObject` representing the sender.
* `Receiver.Status.Status` = `none`

### SINIT -> RSEND
The Receiver issues `PaymentCommand` to update an existing payment.

The receiver VASP examines the `Sender.kyc_data` object, and is satisfied that given the sender information the payment can proceed. It responds with a Payment Command that includes:

* `Receiver.Status.Status` = `ready_for_settlement`
* `Receiver.kyc_data` = The `KycDataObject` representing the receiver.
* `recipient_signature` = a valid recipient signature.

### SINIT -> RABORT
The Receiver issues `PaymentCommand` to update an existing payment.

The receiver VASP examines the sender KYC information and is either not satisfied the payment can proceed, needs more time to process the KYC information, or requires additional information to determine if the payment can proceed. It includes a command to abort the payment with an appropriate error code.

* `Receiver.Status.Status`: `abort`
* `Receiver.Status.abort_code`: one of `no-kyc-needed` or `rejected`.

The sender can initiate a payment on-chain in case of an abort with `no-kyc-needed`.

### RSEND -> READY

The Sender issues `PaymentCommand` to update an existing payment.

The Sender VASP examines the KYC information from the Receiver and is satisfied the payment can proceed.

* `Sender.Status.Status`: `ready_for_settlement`

The payment can be executed on-chain by the sender (or settled in any other way).

### RSEND -> SABORT

The Sender issues `PaymentCommand` to update an existing payment.

The sender VASP requires more time, has a soft match for the receiver or cannot proceed with the payment. It issues an abort command:

* `Sender.Status.Status`: `abort`
* `Sender.Status.abort_code`: one of `pending`, `soft-match`, or `rejected`.

## Steps of the protocol: The soft-match states and flows

### Receiver soft-match (SINIT -> RSOFT -> SSOFTSEND)

After the Sender initiates a payment by providing KYC information (SINIT), the Receiver may determine they require more information to disambiguate a match. In that case they commit a command to set `Receiver.Status.Status` to `soft-match` (state RSOFT) or abort. The sender may respond with a command that populates the `Sender.kyc_data.additional_kyc_data`, which sets the flag `Sx` (state SSOFTSEND) or abort (SABORT). Finally, if the Receiver is satisfied with the additional information they move to provide all information necessary to go to RSEND (See above, this includes receiver KYC information and recipient signature). Otherwise, the receiver can abort to state RABORT.

### Sender soft-match (RSEND -> SSOFT -> RSOFTSEND)

Similarly to the flow above, the Sender at state (RSEND) may decide they need for information about the receiver of the payment to disambiguate a soft-match. They set their status `Sender.Status.Status` to `soft-match` (state SSOFT). The receiver can abort (RABORT) or provide the additional KYC in `Receiever.kyc_data.additional_kyc` (state RSOFTSEND). The sender may then abort (SABORT) or move to READY, and settle the payment.

## Abort codes and `original_payment_reference_id`

The meaning of abort codes in the `Status.abort_code` field of an `PaymentActorObject` are:

* `no-kyc-needed`: the recipient indicates that they are not willing to provide KYC information since they judge that it is not necessary. The payment can be directly executed on chain.
* `rejected`: the payment is rejected. It should not be used in the `original_payment_reference_id` field of a new payment.

# Recipient Signature
Once the recipient side is comfortable that it has received appropriate information and is ready for the transaction to go on-chain, the recipient side will provide their signature in order to support dual attestation. The receiver VASP will sign with the receiver compliance private key. The following is a concrete example of how to generate the Travel Rule dual attestation signable and the recipient signature using Libra Python Client SDK:
```
from pylibra import lcs
from pylibra import libra_types as libra
from pylibra import serde_types as st
...

metadata: Metadata = libra.Metadata__TravelRuleMetadata(
  libra.TravelRuleMetadata__TravelRuleMetadataVersion0(
    libra.TravelRuleMetadataV0(
      off_chain_reference_id="reference_id",
    )
  )
)
// `lcs_metadata` will be used as the `metadata` parameter in encode_peer_to_peer_with_metadata_script()
lcs_metadata = lcs.serialize(metadata, libra.Metadata)

dual_attest_msg_bytes: bytearray = bytearray()
dual_attest_msg_bytes.extend(lcs_metadata)  # Travel Rule metadata
dual_attest_msg_bytes.extend(lcs.serialize(bytes.fromhex("793251de1a61e9b4d1a17d13aa015e45"), bytes))  # Raw on-chain address (https://github.com/libra/lip/blob/master/lips/lip-5.md#terminology)
dual_attest_msg_bytes.extend(lcs.serialize(st.uint64(1000000), st.uint64))  # Amount
dual_attest_msg_bytes.extend(lcs.serialize(b"@@$$LIBRA_ATTEST$$@@", bytes))  # ASCII-encoded Libra Domain Separator string

dual_attest_msg = libra.TransactionArgument__U8Vector(bytes(dual_attest_msg_bytes))
dual_attest_msg_lcs = lcs.serialize(dual_attest_msg, libra.TransactionArgument__U8Vector)

// We sign the bytes LCS bytes directly with the compliance private key
// `receiver_metadata_signature` will be used as the `metadata_signature` parameter in  encode_peer_to_peer_with_metadata_script()
receiver_metadata_signature = compliance_private_key.sign(dual_attest_msg_lcs)
```

The `receiver_metadata_signature` will then be placed into the `recipient_signature` field of the PaymentObject in the off-chain API, thus providing it to the sender so that the sender VASP may submit the transaction on-chain.

# On-chain Transaction Submission
Once both sender and receiver have a status of 'ready_for_settlement', the transaction may then be submitted on-chain by the sender VASP. This submission will utilize the `recipient_signature` which was provided by the receiver VASP (generated via [Recipient Signature](#recipient-signature).  The sender VASP will now generate a transaction via the following and then submit the transaction on-chain:

```
use libra_types::transaction::{
    RawTransaction,
    metadata::{Metadata, TravelRuleMetadata, TravelRuleMetadataV0}
};

metadata = Metadata::TravelRuleMetadata(
  TravelRuleMetadata::TravelRuleMetadataVersion0(
    TravelRuleMetadataV0 {
      off_chain_reference_id: "123abc", /* The off-chain reference ID specified by `reference_id` in the Off-chain APIs */
}));


lcs_metadata = lcs.serialize(metadata, Metadata);

program = encode_peer_to_peer_with_metadata_script(
    "LBR" /*currency*/,
    0x1234 /*recipient*/,
    100 /*amount*/,
    lcs_metadata,
    recipient_signature /* from off-chain API exchange */);

RawTransaction {
    sender_account: 0x7777,
    program: program,
}
```
